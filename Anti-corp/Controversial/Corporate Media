! Title: Cybo's Anti Corporate Media
! Description: A uBlock Origin only list that will warn you before clicking links that lead to the corporate media as they are most often the actual perpetrators of so-called "fake news."

! Corporate media is also often referred to as the "legacy media" or "mainstream media"
!
! While this list shouldn't be used to keep you from using anything considered to be corporate news
! it should be used to help you realize your exposure to these media conglomerates. Most of which
! will publish some form of fake news or clickbait to keep your attention and get you hooked on
! the hate facing America.
!
! With about half of Americans viewing the Biden administration as illegitimate and the other half
! spewing violent hate-based rhetoric towards them for their choice in a political candidate the
! polarization is getting worse and it's profiting most-if not all-of the mainstream outlets.
!
! This list was made with the idea in mind that it's important to understand the grip these
! media conglomerates have on the flow of our information. It will also let you know about
! hate driven media outlets and warn you about them. Don't let hate drive your attention!
!
! I hope this list can help those in my generation (zoomers) and any other generation
! to see the grips money has on our minds. Break free of your chains and take control of
! your mind and being; don't let them control you.
!
! Good quotes to think about:
! “Stop letting people who do so little for you control so much of your mind, feelings and emotions” - Will Smith
!
! “Self-control is the chief element in self-respect, and self-respect is the chief element in courage.” - Thucydides
!
! "We're ashamed to be American, you should probably love it
! 'Cause you have the right to say it and not gеt strung up in public" - Tom MacDonald
!
! "There's a portion of the population that hates America.... They have the support of the 
! culture, the elite and the institutions. We're the ones in the way. We're the dissenting 
! voice. The narrative is America is bad," - John Doyle
!
! "Most politicians have one mission: Say or do whatever it takes to keep your attention
! I guess you think the truth is so boring. They get away with telling lies and you’re dumb enough to vote for em’
! Left, right, republicans, or democrats. Red or blue, different sides on the same crap" - Eric July (Backwardz)
!
! "They never freed the slaves, they realized that they don't need the chains
! They gave us tiny screens, we think we free 'cause we can't see the cage
! They knew that race war would be the game they'd need to play
! For people to pick teams, they use the media to feed the flame" - Tom MacDonald
